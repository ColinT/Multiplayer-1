# Multiplayer
Multiplayer mod for RimWorld

This is the new repository from Zetrith's Multiplayer, as he has left and can not be reached we have decided to work on it ourselves.
If you would like to help work on it we have many things to do, contact someone on the discord, https://discord.gg/89cYfU9


Thanks to Pardeike for making [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) and RevenantX for creating [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib)

Please do all pull requests to the development branch
